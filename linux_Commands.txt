Birth of linux..
------------------
in 1969 they created c programming language and unix os

Basically linux was the kernal ,not operating system in the beginning

unix is mother of the linux 
as unix is the open source collaboration it has more growth
and commercial sale of Unix.


in 1980's :
companies came up with developing their own unix-IBM(AIX)

in 1990's:
the linux source code was online and any one can use it 
then it was collaborated with GNU and became the OS


VARIOUS LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS:
-----------------------------
1.red hat enterprise linux-- it is the most used and most popular due to stable and relaible centOS
2.fedora--
3.debian--ubuntu  free and open source not commercial any one can come and work on it
4.others

ubuntu is the 3rd most used os in the present world,

Linux's features (in comparing with mac and windows):
----------------------------------------------------
-simplified updates for all installed versions
-free software licensing
-access to source code
-multiple distrbutions
-better malware protection (main feature of the linux)


in linux we have root directory.
form the file system we can access all the files in the root directory

/ -- it indicates we are in the root directory.

whenever we download any softwares in the linux it will be downloaded in the bin directory.

linux provide CLI (command line interface) to communicate with the os
CLI is better for tasks which cannot performed with GUI

Hansd on:Linux commands:
-----------------------
1.pwd (present working directory) --it will show the current directory
2./ root directory
3.ls - it will list down all the directories in the current directory
4.cd -- change directory --(cd fileName).
5.clear - it will clear all thecommands in CLI or we can use "ctrl+l" to clear the screen 
6.cd ..  -- it will go back to the previous directory
7.cd   -- it wil go back to the home directory
8.from home we want directly go to the destination directory we can use the path 
eg. :cd Desktop/file1/welcome.txt   (we can use tab to autofill the path of the file)


9.echo -- command used to write arguments to standard output
10.su --used to switch to root user
11 su username --used to switch to a different user
12.sudo -- excutes only that command with root/user privileges

-----------------------------------

working with directories :"ls" commands
----------------------------------------
ls path   :by specifying the path after ls,the content in that path will be displayed
ls -l     :using "l" flag, lists all the contents along with its owner settings ,permissions and time stamp
ls -a     :using "a" flag ,lists all the hidden contents in the specified directory
ls --author:using :-author" flag ,lists the contents along with its owner
ls -S      : using "-S" flag, ,sorts and lists all the contents in the specified directory by size
ls *.html   : it lists only the contents in the directory of a prticular format



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
working with "cd" directories commands:
------------------------------------------
cd ~     :this command also changes the directory to home directory
cd /     :this command changes the directory to root directory
cd ..    :chaanges the directory to parent directory
cd "xx yy": changes the directory to file name directory


---------------------------------------------------------------------
working with files : 'cat' command
-------------------------------------------------
cat    :this is used to display the content of text files and concatenate several files into one
cat -b  :this is used to add line numbers to all the non blank lines
cat -n  :this is used to add line numbers to all lines
cat -s  :this is used to squeeze blank lines to one line
cat -E  :show the end of the line

cat >file_name  : it will ask to enter the data in the file and it will save the file with given file name
	have to enter which type of the file it is..
ctrl+D will help you to come back to the command line
until that what all the lines are written in the terminal will save that in the files

cat file1 file2 it will show all the contents in both the files

cat file1 >> file2 : it will copy the contents of file1 into file2 
  it will add file1 content to file2

-----------------------------------------------------------------
working with "grep command:
--------------------------------
grep "string"(that you want to search) file_name:
	this will search for the given string in the document or file
grep -i "string" :will search for the given string with case senstive

grerp -n "string" :will search for the string and give the line number also

grep -v :this will return the lines not matching the search string

grep -c :this will return the number of lines which results matched search string

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
working with "sort" commands:
----------------------------------
sort file_name : sorts the content of the file and return them in alphabetical order
sort file1 file2 :sort content of the both file1 and file2
sort -r file1: it will retrun the content in reverse order
sort -f  :flag 'f' dose case insensitive sorting.
sort -n    :sorts the content as per the numerical order
--------------------------------------------------------------------
working with '|' commands
-------------------------
the pipe command is used to output the result of one command as input to another command.
'|" with help of pipe command we can perform the two operations in same command
---------------------------------------------------

working with files and directories on 'cp':
------------------------------------------------------------

" cp [options] source destination" 

cp      :this command is used to copy files and directoires
cp -i   :enter interactive mode ; CLI asks before overwriting files
cp -n   :does not overwright the file
cp -u   :updates the destination file only when source file is different from destination file
cp -R   :recursive copy ;copies even hidden files
cp -v   :verbose ; prints informative messages

---------------------------------------------------------------------
woriking with 'mv' command
----------------------------------------
mv source destinatio
mv this command is used to move files and directories
-------------------------------------------------
working with mkdir command:
---------------------------------------
mkdir   :this command is used to create new directory

mkdir -p :this command creates both a new parent directory and sub directory

mkdir --parents :same a -p

----------------------------------------------------

working with rm and rmdir commands:
-------------------------------------------
rmdir    :this command is used to remove the specified directory
rmdir -p  : removes both parent and child directory
rm -r     :removes even non empty directories
rm -rp    :removes non empty directoires including parent and subdirectories

-----------------------------------------------------
working with user persmissons : 'r' ,'w',&'x'
------------------------------------------------
on clicking the ls command we can see all the files in the dir
with ls -l   :it returns all the files with all the details of the file

******check word file for the content here*****



-----------------------------------------------------------------
working with user permissions :'r','w''x':
--------------------------------------------


chmod :to change the access permissions of files and directories
chown :to change the owner of files and directoires
chgrp  :to change the group ownership of file and directories












Doubts to ask:
--------------
1.In ls command :ls -author and autor both are working with same funtion
2.
