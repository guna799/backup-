jenkins demo:
----------------------
life before jenkins:
1.irregular commits
2.issues in integration
3.delay in testing
4.delay in release of software

------------------------------
before developers had to wait till the entire software code was
built and tested to check for errors

due to this software delivery proces was slow

------------------------------------------------------------
what is jenkins...?
jenkins is a continous integration tool that allows continous development
test and deployment of newly created codes

Installations:
jdk latest version
jenkins 


after installation we can run the jenkins on standlone server
jenkins comes with the inbuild server

but we can use jenkins with tomcat also
using jenkins in tomcat server is to run all the applications on same server

for this advantage we use jenkins in the tomcat server

after installing the tomcat ,we can run jenkins in both stanalone and tomcat server

if we create a job in standlone and then we create a job in tomcat server both the jobs can be seen in tomcat server

now we need to change the jenkin to home directory:
reasons behind that is:
when ever it is required we have to install more plugins so that we need more disk space for that


mange users in the jenkins:
by default we are using the admin login
from admin login we can create the new users 
in jenkins dashboard u can find the manage jenkins click on it
all the options for managing jenkins you will find and 
click on the mange users 
there you can create new users with user name and password 

what all the jobs are there in the jenkins you can find in both the users


after creating the users you can configure the users
on the side of your profile you can find configure option
there you can see all the information and 
if it is needed you can update the information

you can dispaly a message on the top of the welcome page 
In that we can use the html for that message.

here we can create and manage the roles in jenkins:
for that we need one plugin called :roles based strategy plugin

this plugin can be dowloaded directly form the google or in dashboard >in manage jenkins >manage plugins 
there we can downlaod the requried jenkins and use it.
after download ,install and restart the jenkins


---------------------------------------------------------------------
admin can manage the roles and can give access to limited resources

for that click on the manage jenkins>configure gloabal security > click on authorisation> 
there we can find roles based stratagy 
only after installing and restart of the jenkins we can find that option
 
once that is done
try to logout with admin adn
login using user details
you will find a pop up showing some read controls denaied

for that only admin can give access to required roles and manage them
in manage jenkins >manage and assign roles > there you can Add users and manage the persmissions

by default you can find global role,project role and slave role 
now it was updated to   golbal role,item role and  node role.


in global role we can add the users and assign them as employee
in item role we can have different roles like tester ,devloper.
so that we can assgin different item role for the different users 
ther is option called pattern where we can have the feature like "dev.*" for the project starting with dev can access to all the developers.
same like that we have can create "test.*" so that all the projects starting with test can be assigned to tester assignees

from now :
we only tester can access the testing projects and
only developer ca have access to the develope projects
in that also we can manage the persmissions like read write and create.

this is how create users and manage users in the jenkins.

----------------------------------------------------------------
to know bsic commands in configure jenkins :

there you can see the system message :where we can have some random message and it will display that in the home page
for that we have html type and plain text type

next option is  excutors: at max how many number of jobs can be done at a time.
if we give there we can run max of 5 jobs at a time

lables in the configure : when we create the new machine and the we have to give labels to the created macine
 
so that all the machines with that lable can access 

quiet period: as soon as the code committed in the build and the it will automactically trigger the jenkins

so that it should have some sleep time between the code commited and it triggers the jenkins the time we give it will schedule the trigger.
by experience we come to know that how much time our code will take from code commits and jenkins to build the jenkins

SCM Check out: after build triggred our jenkins try to connect with the source code in the git or any platform 
if it fails to connect with the source code , how many no of times should jenkins try to connect
what number we will give that many no of times it will try to connect with source code

restrict project naming:
by default it will be on the 


defaul option we can change to role based stratigy or name pattern

if we select name pattern ,then
we have to name any new project with that pattern only
if we try to give any other patterns it will not take 
it will throw an error showing no patterns with the name
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
configure different options in jenkins:

we can see different options like:
general,source code repository,build triggers,build setup,postbuild actions.

in general : we hava discrption 
in respository : git 
in build triggers :If an organization would like to have a CI/CD pipeline setup using plain Jenkins. They will have the build triggers to trigger downstream projects such as

Integration tests
Code scans
Performance Tests
End to End Tests
Deployment.

in build triggers we have options like:
trigger builds remotely
build after other pojects are built
build periodically
poll SCM -source code management


as of now we will se build periodically 


-------------------------------------------------------------
download and install git
to create a master branch we use git init 
it will automatically create a master branch in the location
using git status we can see the current status of the git



git commands:
------------------
git init     	        : to initilise the master branch
git status      	: to know the current status of the branch
git add         	: to add any files to the git
git commit -m"message"  : to commit the newly changed files to the git


git remote add origin "your repo https link"  : this willl add you git repository to the local repository
after add and commit we have one more command

git push -u origin master : this will push all the new committs to the master branch in the git repo

git log               : it will show all the process done till now and discription 
git --help            :it will show all the git commands with the discription

---------------------------------------------------------
integration with git:

create a folder in local machine
create a java or txt file 

now we can add this file to our git repo
using git commands 
initially we have to create a empty repo in the git account
for that we have  ---"git inti"
it will ask for the credientials and it will save
the files in our local machine can be uploaded inthe repo
using git command called "git remote add origin your repo https link

after adding the file 
commit the file
after all the commits we have to push the file to our repo'
so that it will reflect there
once its donegit
we can now connect the jenkins and git 
for that we have to provide the repo link while creating the job
during then new job we can give repo link 
and shell scripts commands for that file in build section

once build is done
we can see the build status in the jenkins
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
addding credientials to the jenkins
we can add using the credientials plugin 
if we are not having that
we can download it from the manage plugins
in avilable we can search and download
if we restart the jenkins it will update the jenkins


------------------------------------------------------------------
intro to CATLIGHT:

faced some issue while installing 

catlight is the status indicator for the task in jenkins

it will notify the status of the task once it is built or it is completed

catlight is used by many automation tools

as we are using the jenkins we will use catlight for the status indicator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is automated deployment..?
we have 4 main phases in the deployment
build 
deploy
test
release


all the jobs are chained in a continous integrated system 

the process involved in deployment:
at first the developers develop some code and they committ the code 
to repos in our case we are using git
once the commits are done in the git 
we build the committs in the jenkins 
if the build is success then it produce the war or ear files we call it as artifcats

after successfully build we deploy the code and
test the code
depending on the organisation we have different test environments
in jenkins the artifacts are sent to some automated test environments in the jenkins hobs
that is test jobs
once it is success 
it willl go to the production environment
that is release.


how to send email form jenkins:
---------------------------------
login to jenkins
mangae jenkins
configure system
after scrolling down we can find email notification
where we need to provide smtp 
smtp.@gmail.com
we need to enter gmail and password for that
we can test the action 
if we come across any errors it will show there
we have to resolve using our google account 
once it is done we can use the gmail for the notification


------------------------------------------------
what is pipeline in jenkins:

a pipeline is a workflow with group of events or jobs that are 
chained and integrated with each other in sequence.

every job in a pipeline has some dependancy on one or more other
jobs.

for every pipe there is inlet and outlet like that

for every job we have inlet and out let
and we have different kind of actions are there once one job is done
combining all the jobs in the build is pipline

lets create 3 jobs 
all 3 jobs are running successfully
now we have to chain all 3 jobs

now we have concept of upstream and down stream
upstream will trigger new task
downstream means it will be triggred as the task

now we have to cofigure the jobs in the chain
we have to start the new job after first job so in configure options
there will be post build options
once it is sucessfull we have to wake up the new job 
so we have to give the name of another job in advanced options
for second job in configure options there is build triggers
there we have to select build after other projects are build
there we have to give the name of the project which it should watch
so that once it is build successfull
then 2nd project will automatically start build
for the 3rd job also same 
in build triggers we have to give the name of the file which
it should look after
once that project is buld successfull then it will start the new build.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to trigger the job form email notification

create a freestyle job in home page.
in configure options
before that we have to download new plugin called poll emailer 
after that it wil come in the configure options.
we have to give the mail and password in the that field 
test the connection 

if everything is good it will work fine

in advance options we can add the subject so that when ever any mail is comming with that subject
then it will trigger the job in jenkins

advantage is without opening the jenkins also we can trigger the job in jenkins

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to view buil monitor view   ?

it is basic plugin that needs to be installed in the jenkins

once it is downloaded in the jenkins
we can see the view in the top of the jenkins home screeen
add the view  as build monitor view 
give the name fo the of build monitor 
click on create
it will redirect you to configure options of the build monitor of the jenkins
there we we can configure the opions like
how much text scale of the job 
colour of the job 
how many jobs in the row 

in that we can see different colours indicating different stages of the build
we can see the when was the last build of the project all the info we can see there
